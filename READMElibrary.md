### Roll Dice
Insert how many rolls you want and it will return an array with those rolls, it might be an interesting utility to add the option to change how many sides your dice has

### Contains Duplicates
I was actually unsure if this method was supposed to accept the array from the previous method

### Calculating Averages
Basically just Arra.reduce()

### Array of arrays
What an absolute mind bender. Took two helper functions and two hours to figure out, and I am positive, absolutely positive that the cannonical solution is like 10 lines long and I made an absolute mountain out of a mole hill. Made me drastically miss Javascript array methods.
