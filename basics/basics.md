# Java Fundaments
## Basics

### Pluraize
Future Features: Compatiablitiy with irregular plurals. Im looking at you Meese

### Coin Flip
I think I could make this code more dry, cutting down on unnecessary variables

### Clock
This one by in large took me the most amount of time, it took well over an hour to learn that directly comparing the strings was returing a true value. 
I researched timer() some, and it seems to me that it a more elegant solution than letting my program cycle 2.2 million times before the second value changes

### Processing Speed
This was the single hardest sounding stretch goal i've ever done, and also the simplest to actually do. I wouldnt mind revisiting this and making it dynamic, such that if a million cycles passes it displays as a MHz but if 4 cycles passes it displays as Hz
