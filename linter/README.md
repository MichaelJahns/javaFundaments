# Java Fundaments
## Linter
In the main method type tally("<path>"), where path is the relative path to the file youd like to lint for semicolons. 
  
This is will return a single string delimited with line breaks highlighting every line in the js file that the linter thinks needs a semicolon. 

## Future Features
Other types of quality control, ability to start from the command line
